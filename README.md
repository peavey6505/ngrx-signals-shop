**Signals Shop** is a completed project developed as part of the NGRX Signal Store course.

**Project Overview**

The application was fully implemented using NGRX Signals. A ready-made user interface was enhanced with complete state management, added progressively throughout the course. The final result demonstrates the practical use and strengths of NGRX Signals in a real-world scenario.

The app features an inventory of fictional signal-related products. Users can browse and search products, add them to the cart, update item quantities, and complete the checkout process. Cart state is persisted in local storage, allowing users to continue where they left off.

**NGRX Features Used**

The project includes key NGRX concepts such as:
- core state and store definition,
- derived state (view models),
- state updates using updaters,
- cart persistence implemented with hooks.
